# SpaceShooter Independent Project 
I developed "SpaceShooter," a dynamic and engaging 2D arcade-style game. The objective of the game is to pilot a spaceship, navigating through an asteroid field while combating enemy ships. Players must use quick reflexes and strategic maneuvering to survive waves of increasingly challenging enemies and obstacles. The game features intuitive controls, vibrant graphics, and an immersive soundtrack, all designed and implemented by myself. This project allowed me to apply and expand my skills in programming, game design, and graphic creation, ultimately resulting in a polished and entertaining final product. Through "SpaceShooter," I demonstrated my ability to manage a complex, multi-faceted project from concept to completion, showcasing both my technical proficiency and creative vision.
